Title: What Is IMPERMANENT LOSS? DEFI Explained - Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, Bancor

1. Impermanent loss is a temporary loss of funds occurring when providing liquidity.
2. It occurs when LPs provide liquidity in standard liquidity pools where one of the assets is volatile in relation to the other.
3. If the LP decides to withdraw their liquidity, the impermanent loss becomes permanent.
4. Impermanent loss is called impermanent because at this point the LP lost only on paper.
5. LPs can make money on their capital by collecting trading fees and participating in liquidity mining programs.
6. Impermanent loss can be minimized by providing liquidity to RF pools, curves liquidity pools, or Balancer pools with arbitrary weights.
7. Bancor v2 pools can adjust their weights automatically based on the external prices coming from price oracles, completely mitigating impermanent loss.
