Title: What are YEARN VAULTS? ETH Vault Explained | DEFI, YIELD FARMING

1. Yearn vaults are pools of funds with an associated strategy for maximizing returns on the asset in the vault.
2. Vault strategies are more active than just lending out coins like in the standard Yearn protocol.
3. Each vault follows a strategy that is voted in by the Yearn community.
4. Yearn vaults were created as a direct response to yield farming and liquidity mining.
5. When tokens are deposited to a vault, the user receives their corresponding Y tokens that can be redeemed for the underlying tokens.
6. Not everything that is deposited into a vault is put in a strategy.
7. The Yearn ETH vault, YETH, puts ETH into a MakerDAO lending platform as collateral and borrows DAI at 200% collateralization ratio.
8. Borrowed DAI is then put into the Yearn DAI vault that uses a strategy that deposits DAI to Curve's Y pool.
9. Providing liquidity to the Curve's pool and locking LP tokens in the Curve gauge result in getting rewarded with extra CRV tokens on top of standard trading fees generated by just supplying liquidity to a pool.
10. The ETH strategy then periodically sells CRV tokens for ETH and uses the trading fees from the Y liquidity pool to accrue even more interest.
11. The YETH vault had already reached 370,000 ETH locked in the vault and it became the largest CDP on MakerDAO.
12. Yield farming can be a pretty time-consuming and expensive activity, so if you're not willing to spend hours searching for the best yield farming opportunity, spend hundreds of dollars in gas fees to move funds around, and keep monitoring your collateralization ratio, it is probably better to rely on the vaults.
13. The ETH deposited as collateral on MakerDAO is susceptible to liquidation if the collateralization ratio falls below 150%.
14. Yearn vaults are one of the most interesting new developments in the DeFi space.
