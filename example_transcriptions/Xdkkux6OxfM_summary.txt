Title: What Are NFTs and How Can They Be Used in Decentralized Finance? DEFI Explained

1. NFTs stand for Non-Fungible Tokens and represent ownership of digitally scarce goods such as art or collectibles.
2. Fungibility is the characteristic of goods or commodities where each individual unit is interchangeable and indistinguishable from each other.
3. ERC-20 is a standard for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, while ERC-721 and ERC-1155 are standards for creating non-fungible tokens.
4. NFTs are unique, provably scarce, and indivisible, and guarantee ownership of the asset, are easily transferable, and are fraud-proof.
5. NFTs can be used in decentralized finance as collateral for borrowing money, representing complex financial products such as insurance, bonds, or options, and even for liquidity mining.
6. The market for NFTs is often illiquid, making price discovery tricky, but some projects use a peer-to-peer loan model where lenders can choose which NFT they are willing to accept as collateral.
7. Examples of NFT projects include Cryptokitties, Gods Unchained, Decentraland, Rarible, SuperRare, OpenSea, Ethereum Naming Service, and Unstoppable Domains.
8. The NFT space is one of the fastest-growing niches in crypto and has huge potential.
