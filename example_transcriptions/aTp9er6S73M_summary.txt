Title: Lending And Borrowing In DEFI Explained - Aave, Compound

1. Lending and borrowing is one of the most important elements of any financial system.
2. DeFi lending allows users to become lenders or borrowers in a completely decentralized and permissionless way while maintaining full custody over their coins.
3. Aave and Compound are two main lending protocols available in DeFi.
4. Both of the protocols work by creating money markets for particular tokens, such as ETH, stablecoins like DAI and USDC, or other tokens like LINK or WRAPPED BTC.
5. In DeFi, at the moment, pretty much all of the loans are over-collateralized.
6. The interest that lenders receive and the interest that borrowers have to pay are determined by the ratio between supplied and borrowed tokens in a particular market.
7. The interest APYs are calculated per ETH block.
8. Aave also offers stable borrow APY.
9. Stable APY is fixed in the short term, but it can change in the long term to accommodate changes in the supply-demand ratio between tokens.
10. Aave also offers flash loans, where users can borrow funds with no upfront collateral for a very short period of time, one ETH transaction.
11. Compound issues C tokens, in this case, C ETH.
12. C ETH keeps accumulating interest even if it's sent from the original wallet that initiated the deposit to another wallet.
13. Aave uses a similar model with interest being accumulated every single block.
14. The main difference is that A token's value is pegged to the value of the underlying tokens at a 1 to 1 ratio.
15. To determine the value of collateral, Compound uses its own price feed that takes prices from several highly liquid exchanges.
16. Aave relies on Chainlink and falls back to their own price feed if necessary.
17. Different lending, although reducing a lot of risks associated with centralized finance, comes with its own risks.
