Title: How Does AMPLEFORTH Work? DEFI Explained

1. Ampleforth is a new cryptocurrency with a unique feature - its supply is elastic and can change every day, while the ownership of the Ample tokens is never diluted.
2. Elastic money supply allows for printing new money or removing money from circulation depending on demand.
3. Ampleforth is non-dilutive, achieved by applying supply adjustments proportionally across everyone's balances.
4. Ampleforth tries to solve the inelasticity problem and diversification problem faced by other cryptocurrencies.
5. There are three states that the Ampleforth protocol can be in - expansion, contraction, or equilibrium.
6. Price oracles are used to provide external prices to smart contracts.
7. The target price is currently at 1.009 US dollars, and it represents the 2019 purchasing power of the US dollar as represented by CPI.
8. Expansion and contraction are achieved automatically by a rebase function in the protocol.
9. The Ampleforth protocol is implemented as a set of smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.
10. Ampleforth aims at diversifying cryptocurrency portfolios, being used as collateral in DeFi protocols, and creating an alternative to central bank money that is adaptable to shocks.
11. Ampleforth created an incentive program called Geyser where liquidity providers of the Uniswap Ample ETH pool can stake their LP tokens on Geyser and be rewarded with extra Ample tokens.
