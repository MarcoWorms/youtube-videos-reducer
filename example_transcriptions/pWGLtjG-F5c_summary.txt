Title: CODE IS LAW? Smart Contracts Explained (Ethereum, DeFi)

1. Smart contracts are pieces of code that can be executed automatically and in a deterministic way.
2. Smart contracts aim at removing the human factor from decision making.
3. Smart contracts follow if-then semantics, which makes them fairly easy to program.
4. Smart contracts can rely purely on the information available on the blockchain or on an external data source.
5. Ethereum is a good example of a blockchain that supports smart contracts and makes it possible for a programmer to implement their own smart contracts.
6. Smart contracts have a growing number of use cases ranging from payments and decentralized finance to supply chain and crowdfunding.
7. One of the main risks when it comes to smart contracts is bugs.
8. Even if a smart contract doesn't have any bugs and has been audited, we still cannot guarantee that the change on the platform level will not cause any problems.
9. Real world issues that cannot be easily communicated by Oracle services are also a risk.
10. Smart contracts are not a replacement for lawyers, but they can provide valuable knowledge that can be translated into code.
