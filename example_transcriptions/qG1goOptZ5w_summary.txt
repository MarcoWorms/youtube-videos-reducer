Title: YEARN FINANCE And YFI Token Explained | DeFi, Ethereum

1. Yearn Finance is a yield optimizer that focuses on maximizing DeFi capabilities by automatically switching between different lending protocols.
2. The YEARN protocol creates a pool for each stablecoin and issues Y tokens that are yield-bearing equivalents of the coin that was deposited.
3. The protocol checks if there is a better yield available at the time a user deposits or withdraws money from the pool, triggering a rebalance of the pool if necessary.
4. Yearn vaults are pools of funds with an associated strategy for maximizing returns on the asset in the vault.
5. The Yearn community votes on the strategy for each vault.
6. The WIFI token is a governance token that allows other people to make meaningful decisions on the future of the protocol.
7. The WIFI token had no pre-mine, no VCs allocation, and even no team reward.
8. The WIFI token is extensively used in the Yearn governance to decide on the future of the protocol.
9. Yearn is one of the most interesting protocols in the DeFi space, but associated risks should always be understood before using it.
